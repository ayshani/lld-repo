Router Management App
-------------------------

This should be written in Java. There is no need for any kind of user interface/test harness for this question.
A simple set of classes is fine. Also, no need for persistence (db, xml file, etc.) – everything can be done in memory:



Please provide source code for a set of classes that:

* Manage packets in a router: A packet can contain either management data or user data. A packet can also be either
large or small (two discrete values).

* Allows packets to be entered into the system (just with a method call -- no need for any type of user interface)

* Allows the highest priority packet to be removed from the system – management data is always higher priority than
user data. Within a given type (management or user), a large packet is higher priority than a small packet.

All else being equal, packets that have been in the queue longer should be removed before packets that have not
been waiting as long.
