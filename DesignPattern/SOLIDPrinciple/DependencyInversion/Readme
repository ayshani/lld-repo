Dependency Inversion
-----------------------
The principle of dependency inversion refers to the decoupling of software modules.
This way, instead of high-level modules depending on low-level modules, both will depend on abstractions.

The Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) states that high-level modules should not depend on low-level modules,
but rather both should depend on abstractions. The abstractions should not depend on details. Instead,
the details should depend on abstractions.

In many cases, thinking about the interaction between modules as an abstract concept allows the linking of
components to be reduced without the need for more coding patterns to be implemented. This allows for a functional
scheme with reduced implementation and allows the system to be more flexible.
